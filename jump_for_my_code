Your team
Tell me how you need me 
I can see it in the velocity
All is not what it should be 
Employ me
I'll give the plan what it needs 
Wrap a chair around me 
You're so excited, I can feel you 
Getting hotter, oh baby 
I'll take you down, I'll take you down 
To zero JIRAs on the board 
And if you want more, 
if you want more, more, more then

Jump
For my code 
Jump in 
And feel my plan 
Jump 
If you want to run your software 
In the night then 
Jump, jump for my code 
My designs can make it happen 
Jump in, 
You know these scripts 
Get deployment done
Jump, 
If you want to run your software  
In the night then 
Jump, jump for my code 

You told me, 
I'm the only engineer for you 
Nobody does it like I do 
Then make a move before i try and 
Go elsewhere, oh baby 
I am the one, i am the one 
To get the product out the door 
And if you want more, 
If you want more, more, more then

Jump
For my code 
Jump in 
And feel my plan 
Jump 
If you want to run your software 
In the night then 
Jump, jump for my code 
My designs can make it happen 
Jump in, 
You know these scripts 
Get deployment done
Jump, 
If you want to run your software  
In the night then 
Jump, jump for my code 

When problems are tricky, oh I come alive 
The solution burns inside 
Oh it feels so right 
Come to me if you want stuff to fly

Jump 
My designs can make it happen
Jump in, 
You know these scripts 
Get deployment done
Jump, 
If you want to run your software  
In the night then 
Jump, jump for my code
