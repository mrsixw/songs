Everybody's doin' a brand new drive now
(C'mon baby join the revolution)
I know you'll get to like it
If you give it a chance now
(C'mon baby join the revolution)
My little baby sister can drive it with ease
It’s better than rockin’ a Renault twizzy
So come on, come on, 
Join the revolution with an i3
